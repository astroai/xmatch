## 2026-04-27 - Unnecessary DataFrame Copies
**Learning:** In astronomical data processing with large datasets, deep copying pandas DataFrames `df.copy()` unconditionally before data validation or writing can cause massive memory and CPU overhead. The codebase had an instance in `src/xmatch/stilts.py` where a copy was made just to convert potential `object` columns to strings. Often these datasets are purely numeric and have no `object` columns.
**Action:** When working with `pandas` DataFrames, only deep copy when mutation is strictly required (e.g., after checking if `object` columns even exist). Check condition first, copy later.

## 2026-04-28 - Unnecessary DataFrame Copies in FITS Preparation
**Learning:** Astronomical catalogues are typically purely numeric and very large. Unconditionally copying a DataFrame (`df.copy()`) before checking if `object` column string conversions are needed creates a massive, unnecessary memory overhead and slows down data preparation significantly.
**Action:** Always check `df.select_dtypes(include=["object"]).columns` first. Only create a `.copy()` if string conversions are actually required; otherwise, pass the original DataFrame reference.

## 2026-04-29 - Avoid DataFrame copy for numeric datasets
**Learning:** Unconditionally copying a Pandas DataFrame (`df.copy()`) before checking if any column type conversion is needed (e.g., for object type columns) creates significant memory and execution overhead, especially since astronomical datasets are typically very large and purely numeric.
**Action:** Always check if a transformation (e.g., string conversion) is actually necessary before making a defensive copy of a DataFrame. For example, conditionally create `df.copy()` only when `df.select_dtypes(include=["object", "string"])` returns non-empty.

## 2024-05-24 - Pandas Shallow Copy Optimization
**Learning:** In pandas, `df.copy()` creates a deep copy by default, duplicating both the metadata and the underlying data arrays. In `xmatch`, which processes large astronomical datasets (DataFrames), making deep copies inside internal propagation and local matching functions incurs heavy memory and CPU overhead. Also, `dict.copy()` does not take any arguments, so applying the same optimization to dictionaries blindly causes `TypeError`.
**Action:** When working with pandas DataFrames, use `df.copy(deep=False)` when you only need to assign new columns (like `ra_propagated`) without modifying existing data. This creates a new object referencing the same data buffer, yielding identical functionality with significantly less overhead. Only apply this to DataFrames and not dictionaries.

## 2024-05-24 - Avoiding iterrows() with NumPy Array Dictionaries
**Learning:** Using `df.iterrows()` and `.iloc` lookups inside a loop when iterating over a `pandas` DataFrame is an extreme performance bottleneck. While converting the DataFrame to a list of dictionaries using `df.to_dict('records')` avoids `iterrows()`, it can introduce a massive memory overhead and lead to OOM errors on large astronomical datasets. Additionally, using `df.itertuples()` is unsafe because any column name that isn't a valid Python identifier will be renamed, breaking dynamic property access via `getattr()`.
**Action:** When you must loop over rows of a DataFrame and `to_dict('records')` is too memory-intensive, extract the underlying NumPy arrays into a dictionary using `{col: df[col].to_numpy() for col in df.columns}`. Iterate over the length of the DataFrame `for i in range(len(df)):` and access values using `array_dict[col][i]`. This provides O(1) access speed, correctly preserves all original string column names, and has virtually zero memory overhead.
